    <h1>Is Muni’s Central Subway in San Francisco Really Efficient?</h1>
    <h2>1. The Background and the Idea (8/6/24)</h2>

    <p>I’m a massive transit nerd and advocate – I believe that to get ourselves out of the car-centric, polluting cities we’ve built over the past over half a century, better mass transit, and cities built around said mass transit is the way forward. </p>
    <p>Which brings us to San Francisco, just under an hour north of San Jose where I live in the Bay Area. San Francisco has amazing public transit – a regional metro system (BART), streetcar / subway / light rail (Muni Metro), various bus lines, and a commuter rail system (Caltrain) set to see massive improvements this year. </p>
    <p>But here I will focus on the quasi-streetcar / subway / light rail system, known as Muni Metro. Muni Metro is operated by Muni, shorthand for what used to be the San Francisco Municipal Railway, now the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which operates not just Muni Metro, but the various bus lines crisscrossing throughout the city, as well as the historic cable cars and historic streetcars within the city. </p>
    <p>Now Muni Metro is not really a “metro” – it is really more of a streetcar / light rail network that runs mostly on the street in mixed traffic, or in street medians, before, with the current exception of the T Third Street line, converges into the Market Street Subway where it runs underground below Market Street. This is what makes Muni Metro so famously unreliable – though it may be quick under Market Street, once it leaves the tunnel, it is at the mercy of pedestrians and cars, as well as traffic lights, significantly slowing trains down and keeping the timetable difficult. </p>
    <p>Now as mentioned earlier, the T Third Street (from here on, the T) doesn’t run under Market Street. This is due to the recent opening in late 2022 of the Central Subway, a new subway tunnel that runs north-south, just north of 4th and Brannan Street to Chinatown, which the T was rerouted to. </p>
    <p>Whether the Central Subway was worth it has been a point of discussion amongst many people. The Central Subway is 1.7 mi, or 2.7 km long [1], and cost 1.95 billion dollars, putting the price tag at over a billion dollars per mile for a relatively short distance. Though I believe in spending taxpayer dollars on public transit, money poorly spent is money that could have been spent on another project that would have been better utilized. Another issue are the depths at which the station is located – Chinatown Station is located 100 ft underground [3]. Though this is due to geographical and infrastructure obstacles that were unavoidable, the depth of the stations mean that riders must take multiple minutes simply to either reach the platform or exit the station, costing riders valuable time that the subway was supposed to have saved them in the first place. What really makes this project questionable to many however, is the fact that the 15 Bayview Hunters Point Express, 30 Stockton and 45 Union-Stockton, a total of 3 bus lines already runs nearly the same route that the Central Subway does, but instead of terminating at Chinatown, keeps going further northwest. Add to that the fact that whereas the T runs every 10 minutes, the 30 runs more frequently at all times of the day, and the 45 runs every 10 minutes morning and midday, and the 15, 30, and 45 seem much more reliable for simply showing up and hopping on. While the subway undeniably is more efficient once underground, combine all the above facts with the fact that the T needs to run about half a mile to enter the tunnel while obeying traffic lights anyway, and suddenly, the 30 or 45 seem to be a more reliable route to take. </p>
    <p>Here, I am going to investigate (at least under the specified conditions), if the Central Subway, in its current form really is a good investment, and a good mode of transportation for commuters and residents of the Bay Area. </p>
