  <h1>Measuring Permeability of Free Space &mu;<sub>0</sub> Using Mutual Induction</h1>
  <p>This was a project I chose to do for an independent measurement in one of my undergraduate physics classes, PHYS 20CL. It involved creating various concentric rings of conductive wire around a small ring of wire, where each ring had a resistor applied to it. When a constant rate of change in voltage was applied to the outer ring from a function generator, it created a constant rate of change in current, and therefore, a constant rate of change in magnetic field and flux within the outer ring. This rate of change in magnetic flux within the outer ring meant that there was a constant rate of change of magnetic flux within the inner ring, which induced voltage across the circuit of the inner ring. This induced voltage generated current, which was measured using an electrometer. Using this measured induced current along with other known and measured variables, I was able to measure the permeability of free space commonly denoted as &mu;<sub>0</sub>. Though the results were not accurate, the data collected reflected a trend consistent with known physical formulas derived in the project - the more turns per outer coil, the more voltage was induced in the inner coil.</p>
  <p>As this was a project done for a class, it was finished on LaTeX, and is in the form of a PDF. The PDF can be accessed via the link below.</p>
