    <h1>Is Muni’s Central Subway in San Francisco Really Efficient?</h1>
    <h2>The Background and the Idea (8/6/24)</h2>
    <p>I’m a massive transit nerd and advocate – I believe that to get ourselves out of the car-centric, polluting cities we’ve built over the past over half a century, better mass transit, and cities built around said mass transit is the way forward. </p>
    <p>Which brings us to San Francisco, just under an hour north of San Jose where I live in the Bay Area. San Francisco has amazing public transit – a regional metro system, streetcar/light rail, various bus lines, and a commuter rail system set to see massive improvements this year. </p>
    <p>But here I will focus on the quasi-streetcar / subway / light rail system, known as Muni Metro. Muni Metro is operated by Muni, shorthand for what used to be the San Francisco Municipal Railway, now the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which operates not just Muni Metro, but the various bus lines crisscrossing throughout the city, as well as the historic cable cars and historic streetcars within the city. </p>
    <p>Now Muni Metro is not really a “metro” – it is really more of a streetcar / light rail network that runs mostly on the street in mixed traffic, or in street medians, before, with the current exception of the T Third Street line, converges into the Market Street Subway where it runs underground below Market Street. This is what makes Muni Metro so famously unreliable – though it may be quick under Market Street, once it leaves the tunnel, it is at the mercy of pedestrians and cars, as well as traffic lights, significantly slowing trains down and keeping the timetable difficult. </p>
    <p>Now as mentioned earlier, the T Third Street (from here on, the T) doesn’t run under Market Street. This is due to the recent opening in late 2022 of the Central Subway, a new subway tunnel that runs north-south, just north of 4th and Brannan Street to Chinatown, which the T was rerouted to. </p>
    <p>Whether the Central Subway was worth it has been a point of discussion amongst many people. The Central Subway is 1.7 mi, or 2.7 km long [1], and cost 1.95 billion dollars, putting the price tag at over a billion dollars per mile for a relatively short distance. Though I believe in spending taxpayer dollars on public transit, money poorly spent is money that could have been spent on another project that would have been better utilized. Another issue are the depths at which the station is located – Chinatown Station is located 100 ft underground [3]. Though this is due to geographical and infrastructure obstacles that were unavoidable, the depth of the stations mean that riders must take multiple minutes simply to either reach the platform or exit the station, costing riders valuable time that the subway was supposed to have saved them in the first place. What really makes this project questionable to many however, is the fact that the 30 Stockton and 45 Union-Stockton, two very busy and popular bus lines already runs nearly the same route that the Central Subway does, but instead of terminating at Chinatown, keeps going further northwest. Add to that the fact that whereas the T runs every 10 minutes, the 30 runs every 7 minutes in the morning and 6 minutes midday, and the 45 runs every 10 minutes morning and midday, and the 30 and 45 seem to be much more reliable for simply showing up and hopping on. While the subway undeniably is more efficient, combine all the above facts with the fact that the T needs to run about half a mile to enter the tunnel while obeying traffic lights, and suddenly, the 30 or 45 seem to be a more reliable route to take. </p>
    <p>Here, I am going to investigate (at least under the specified conditions), if the Central Subway, in its current form really is a good investment, and a good mode of transportation for commuters and residents of the Bay Area. </p>

    <h2>The Experiment (8/6/24)</h2>
    <p>The average commuter coming into San Francisco who takes the T or the 30 or the 45 will get off the Caltrain station at 4th and King St, and then proceed to get on the T at the station of the same name just across King St, or get on the 30 or 45 at Townsend St & Lusk St.</p>
    <p>Assuming that the average commuter is an office worker, they will want to get to downtown San Francisco. For this reason, I will choose Union Square as our destination, as it is a popular gathering place downtown, and for most destinations in downtown San Francisco, regardless of whether you take the T or the 30 / 45, the mode of transportation should be more or less the same (one of the other Muni Metro lines or BART). For fairness’ sake, I will choose the Dewey Monument as our goal, as it is at the center of Union Square.</p>
    <p>To test which option is truly faster, I will on the same day of the week at the same time range, measure the time it takes to get from the Caltrain station, northbound to the Dewey Monument on either the T or the 30 / 45. I will start measuring the time when I leave the doors of the Caltrain station and stop measuring once I reach the Dewey Monument. I will repeat the same trip at least 5 times (the minimum required number of datapoints to perform a statistical analysis in physics) for each mode of transportation, that is subway or bus (T or 30 / 45) and find the mean and standard deviation for each mode. I will then perform a statistical t-test to see if the run times for the subway are statistically significant. As I am going to have to return to the Caltrain station for the beginning of the next run, I will also measure trips in the opposite direction, going southbound. Though this should be a reverse rush-hour trip, it may still yield interesting results and / or findings. The methodology will be identical to the northbound trips. Times will be measured starting at the Dewey monument, and stopped when I reach the doors of the Caltrain station at 4th and King St. As headways are assumed to be theoretically consistent within each Muni line (it is not in real life), to avoid falling into a possible pattern, where once I reach a destination, the time spent waiting for the next train or bus is identical between each runs, I will use different modes of transport on the northbound and southbound trips for a given day. In other words, if I take the T for a northbound trip, I will take the 30 / 45 for the southbound trip. I will keep the mode of transport per direction consistent on a given day. In other words, on the first day (assumed to be 8/8/24, a Thursday), I will take the T northbound, and then take the 30 / 45 southbound from around 9 AM until 12 PM. On another Thursday (likely 8/22/24), I will take the T southbound, and then the 30 / 45 northbound from around 9 AM until 12 PM.</p>
    <p>This methodology should account for walking distance from the train / bus stop to and from the destination or departure point by including time spent walking within the measured time. By intentionally breaking possible patterns I could fall into in terms of timing for when I return to an origin point to start my next run, I account for headway effectively by randomizing when I show up at the train / bus stop for the next vehicle. This experiment should also account for traffic patterns that both Muni Metro trains and Muni buses get caught up in, by choosing the same day of the week and timeframe in which to conduct both trips. Though the scope of this personal experiment is quite limited as of currently, testing over different distances, such as making the destination farther, like Chinatown, or testing over another time period could be interesting as well. I plan on taking data starting 8/8/24</p>
