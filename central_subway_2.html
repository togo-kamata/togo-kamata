    <h1>Is Muni’s Central Subway in San Francisco Really Efficient?</h1>
    <h2>2. Measuring (Invalidated) Data (8/22/24)</h2>
    <p><a href="central_subway_1.html">1. Previous Article: Is Muni’s Central Subway in San Francisco Really Efficient? (8/6/24)</a></p>
    <p>I took my first set of data points on 8/8/2024, a Thursday. Note that this article is being written AFTER the data was collected...</p> 

    <p>In this article we will cover:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A quick explainer of the routes taken in collecting data.</li>
        <li>An overview of the northbound run including methods.</li>
        <li>A similar overview but this time for the southbound run.</li>
        <li>A display of the data and what went wrong in the data collection.</li>
        <li>Some statistical analysis (though we won't do too much of this as the data is flawed anyway).</li>
        <li>Some comments for what I would do differently on my next run.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>I arrived at San Francisco 4th and King station around 8:00 AM and after having visited an office that a high school friend was interning at, I proceeded to take data around 8:25 AM...</p>

    </figure>

    <p>I measured not only the total time between starting point and ending point, but time between any significant events within the trip as well...</p>
    <p>For northbound runs (T Third Street), these times between significant events were:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Walk time between Caltrain station to the T platform at 4th and King.</li>
        <li>Wait time on the 4th and King platform for a T train to arrive.</li>
        <li>Ride time between 4th and King to Union Square station on the T.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>(I started measuring a rough time taken for the train to actually reach the Central Subway tunnel starting on my second run as well.)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Walk time between Union Square station platform to the Dewey Monument.</li>  
    </ol>

    <p>For southbound runs (30 Stockton / 45 Union Stockton), these times between significant events were:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Walk time from the Dewey Monument to the bus stop at Stockton and Geary.</li>
        <li>Wait time at the Stockton and Geary bus stop for the next 30 or 45 to arrive.</li>
        <li>Ride time between Stockton and Geary to Townsend and 4th near the Caltrain station.</li>
        <li>Walk time between Townsend and 4th to the Caltrain station.</li>  
    </ol>

    <p>An overview of the Northbound run involves:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Leaving the Caltrain Station at 4th and King streets...</li>
