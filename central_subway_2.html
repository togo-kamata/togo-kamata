    <h1>Is Muni’s Central Subway in San Francisco Really Efficient?</h1>
    <h2>2. Measuring (Invalidated) Data (8/22/24)</h2>
    <p><a href="central_subway_1.html">1. Previous Article: Is Muni’s Central Subway in San Francisco Really Efficient? (8/6/24) </a></p>
    <p>I took my first set of data points on 8/8/2024, a Thursday. Note that this article is being written AFTER the data was collected. I arrived at San Francisco 4th and King station around 8:00 AM and after having visited an office that a high school friend was interning at, I proceeded to take data around 8:25 AM. As I described in the previous section "The Experiment", for this day, I took a trip from the 4th and King Caltrain station to the Dewey Monument in Union Square using Muni Metro's T Third Street line, routed through the Central Subway at the centerpiece of this project. I then took Muni's 30 Stockton or 45 Union Stockton bus back to the 4th and King Caltrain station. This was repeated 5 times (quite exhausting to be honest, but still quite fun).</p>

    <p>I measured not only the total time between starting point and ending point, but time between any signficant events within the trip as well. This was done by simply pressing "lap" on my stopwatch. All of these times between significant events when added together would equal the total time between the starting and ending point.</p>
    <p>For northbound runs (T Third Street), these times between significant events were:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Walk time betweeen Caltrain station to the T platform at 4th and King</li>
    <li>Wait time on the 4th and King platform for a T train to arrive</li>
    <li>Ride time between 4th and King to Union Square station on the T</li>
      <ul>
      <li>(I started measuring a rough time taken for the train to actually reach the Central Subway tunnel starting on my second run as well)</li>
    <li>Walk time between Union Square station platform to the Dewey Monument</li>  
    </ol>

    <p>For southbound runs (30 Stockton / 45 Union Stockton), these times between significant events were:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Walk time from the Dewey Monument to the bus stop at Stockton and Geary</li>
    <li>Wait time at the Stockton and Geary bus stop for the next 30 or 45 to arrive</li>
    <li>Ride time between Stockton and Geary to Townsend and 4th near the Caltrain station</li>
    <li>Walk time between Townsend and 4th to the Caltrain station</li>  
    </ol>

    <p>An overview of the Northbound run involves:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Leaving the Caltrain Station at 4th and King streets. The stopwatch was started the moment I left the doors of the station facing 4th and King streets.</li>

        <figcaption>I started measuring the time the moment I walked out of the doors at the Caltrain Station facing the intersection of 4th and King streets. (Picture taken 8/8/24)</figcaption>
     </figure>
    <li>Walking to the T platform. This involved crossing two crosswalk, first across King street, and then half of 4th street onto the T platform in the medan of 4th street. The time for "Walk time betweeen Caltrain station to the T platform at 4th and King" stops when I finish climbing the ramp onto the T platform.</li>

The entrance to the Central Subway is just visible at the center of the image where an overpass and tunnel entrance exists. Note the Caltrain station on the left side. The moment I got over the ramp, "lap" was clicked on my stopwatch, and time spent walking between the Caltrain and T platform stopped recording, and time spent waiting for the T train started recording. (Picture taken 8/8/24)</figcaption>
     </figure>
    <li>Waiting for the T Third Street train that would take me to Union Square Station. The moment I get to the T platform, wait time for the T train begins. The wait time for the T ends when I step on the train, and the stopwatch then measures the time I spend on the train to Union Square station.</li>

        <figcaption>The T train arrives at platform. Time spent waiting ends when I step on the train. The stopwatch then starts measuring the time I spent on the train itself. (Picture taken 8/8/24)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <li>Taking the T to Union Square station. Time spent on the train starts when I step on the train, and ends when I step off of it at Union Square station. The T runs about half a mile north on the median of 4th street, obeying traffic lights until it enters the Central Subway just ahead of the intersection on 4th and Bryant streets. Union Square station is the 3rd stop. The T stops at 4th and Brannan, still in the median of 4th street, and then once in the Central Subway, at Yerba Buena / Moscone Center, and then at Union Square / Market Street Station. The T would continue on one more stop to Chinatown Rose Pak station where the line ends. Unforntuately I have no image of the ride.</li>
    <li>Leaving Union Square station, and heading to the Dewey Monument. Once I step off the train, the stopwatch begins measuring the time spent walking from the platform to the Dewey Monument close by. I took the exit from the platform that directed me to Powell station nearby where I could transfer to the other Muni Metro lines as well as BART. Once past the fare gates, I turned left to the exit at Stockton and Ellis street. I took care not to walk on the escalators.</li>
